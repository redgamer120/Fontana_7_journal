// You said or when you refered to the things we learned about in cs or cs with arduinos
1. I learned to write java code. With this I made games. Now I have some real game development background.
2. I learned to program an mini-computer called an arduino. This was a really nifty skill and I was able to make a nice game from it. I could also get this computer to make really cool music/songs.
3. I lastly learned how to work the desbain interface on our computers. This really helped in class. Now I can go home and use desbain at home and help others in my house with it.
