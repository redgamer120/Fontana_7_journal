My thoughts for my art project are a sword with the lengend of Zelda symbol on it.
I don't know what methods I will use for it.
For me to incorperate a loop it would be to make the lengend of Zelda symbol.
To use an if, if else, or and else loop would be really hard for me.
The math I would have to incorperate would be be for the angles and such.
