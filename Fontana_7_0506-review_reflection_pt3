1. 43 is the x maximum and 67 is the y maximum because the first number sets how many different rows there are while the second number adds length to thoes rows.
2. if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888:); this code asks if i is equal to 0 and if it is it will print 8888.
3. System.out.print(map[i][j]); this code will print the map with all the values that have been given to the objects in the map.
4. System.out.println("."); this code will print a period on the next line of the console that poped up. This is different for System.out.print("8888") because that one will print on the same line while this one will print on the next line.
5. System.out.println(map[i][j]); this code will print the map on the next line of you console.
6. I while loop looks to see if something is true and if it is it will do whats in its prameters. So before the loop make a vaiable true then in the loop's prameters put that varable.
7. The use of a static is to share the same value through out the same program under one name.
8. You could use a unicode letter as a wall.
if (j == 0 || i == 0) {
	System.out.print(" * ");
        } else if (j == 18 || i == 18) {
       		System.out.print(" * ");
        } else {
                System.out.print(" . ");
        }
