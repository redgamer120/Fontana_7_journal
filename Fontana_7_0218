That code is the code for the running sprite.
It would be very unproductive to remember Slick syntax - we are tying to remember/learn what this code does.
An array is a storage of one type of datatype.
To make an int array is int[] anArray;
An array list is a way to let array's grow as they need to.
To make an array list this code is used List<MyClass> list = new ArrayList<MyClass>();
With the '#nameOfArraylist.remove(1);' to remove element from the given index. Or with '#nameOfArraylist.add('#nameOfNewThingInArray'); you add something into that array. Or with '#nameOfArraylist.remove('#nameOfNewThingInArray');' you can remove a specific thing of that array.
The diference between them is that arraylist is for an array to grow and shrink.


Ex
button1.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {

  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) {

    label1.setVisible(true);

    Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
           int counter =1 ;

           public void run() {
               while(true) {

                    while (counter<5)  {
                        SwingUtilties.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
                               public void run() {
                                   label1.setText("counter  is " + counter);
                               }
                        }); 

                        counter = counter + 1 ;
                        try {
                           Thread.sleep(1000);
                        }catch(InterruptedException ex) {
                            System.err.println(ex.toString());

                        }    
                    } 
                counter = 1;
                tk.beep();

                }

           }
    };

     new Thread(runnable).start();

});
